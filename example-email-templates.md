How Sarah ({{personalityType}}) went from $2K losses to consistent profits
```

**Body:**
```html
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto;">
  <h2>Hey {{firstName}},</h2>

  <p>I want to share a quick case study with you about Sarah, a trader who shares your personality type: <strong>{{personalityType}}</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Sarah's Story:</strong></p>

  <p>When Sarah took our quiz, she discovered she was an {{personalityType}}. Like many traders with this personality, she struggled with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Second-guessing her entries</li>
    <li>Over-analyzing setups until opportunities passed</li>
    <li>Taking profits too early out of fear</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Sound familiar?</p>

  <p>After implementing a trading system designed for {{personalityType}}s, Sarah:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>✅ Increased her win rate from 42% to 68%</li>
    <li>✅ Reduced emotional trading by 80%</li>
    <li>✅ Hit her first $10K profit month</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>The key?</strong> She stopped fighting her personality and started working WITH it.</p>

  <p><a href="https://yourlink.com" style="display: inline-block; background: #4F46E5; color: white; padding: 12px 24px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px; font-weight: bold;">See How She Did It</a></p>
